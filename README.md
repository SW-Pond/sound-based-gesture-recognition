# SOUND-BASED GESTURE RECOGNITION

This uses the Doppler Effect to recognize gestures.
Refer to the provided picture for the gestures that are currently 
supported and how to perform them.

To get started:
- Ensure pip is set up for downloading packages from the terminal / 
  command prompt.
- Clone the repo or download as a .zip and extract.
- Open the terminal / command prompt and cd to the directory of the 
  download.
- Enter: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run main.py

Tips for best results:
- Start a gesture at the position shown in the picture with your
  hand still and wait until a new score appears to start the gesture;
  stop the gesture with your hand still until the gesture displays.
- Perform the gesture mostly within the bounds of the left and right speakers.
- Perform the gesture with your palm relaxed and open (not perfectly flat).
- Gestures performed very slowly will likely not be recognized.

Note:
- Tabletop gestures are performed in the same plane as the keyboard.
- Whiteboard gestures are perfomed in the same plane as the screen.
